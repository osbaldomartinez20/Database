# What can be changed
	*In Random_Key_Value.java there is a list, String[] val, that contains the
		values that could be inserted into the database.
	*The values are picked at random, so if you want to see other values being selected
		you can modify the list. 
	*The method getRandKey() in Random_Key_Value.java generates the keys based on time.
	    If you want different type of id, modify the method.
